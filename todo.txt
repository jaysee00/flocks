* BUG: When un-pausing, the first update shouldn't time jump ahead to make up for the elapsed real time.
* BUG: Investigate why boids sometimes do a full 180deg when rotation should be constrained
* TIDY: Tidy up rendering of debug vectors - make the lines a bit thinner and also render the target vector vs. actual vector. 
* TIDY: Render boid ID in debug log (May need to move to integers instead of UUIDs so its readable).
    ** Therefore may need an atomic ID generator (easy because we're single-threaded.)
* TIDY: Tidy up console logging so it's easy to audit each update frame 
** Indentation
** Each update frame & render frame has a border
** Try some identifying colours (eg. https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2019-03-14-pretty-javascript-console/)
*** Or something like this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-browser-log
* Define a target location for each flock to simulate more natural looking movements.
* Allow user input to control:
    * Number of flocks
    * Boids per flock
    * Flocking behaviour strengths
    * Simulation speed
* Add nice styling to page layout.
* Add a predator behaviour
* Add a hiding behaviour? 
* Set production webpack behaviour (https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/)
* Minimise CSS w/ webpack (https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/#minimizing-for-production)
